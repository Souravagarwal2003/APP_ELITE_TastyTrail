Recipe Finder UI
Build a front-end interface to browse or search recipes.

## Features Implemented

- Static recipe data set of 30 diverse dishes with images, ingredients, and instructions.

## Tech Stack Used

- HTML5 & CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Glassmorphism, 3D transforms)

- No external frameworks used (lightweight, pure front-end)
- Hosted as static files, easily deployable on any static hosting platform
